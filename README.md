# Flashcard-generation
A hybrid workflow that combines human understanding with AI efficiency to create high-quality Anki flashcards following expert memorisation principles. A full, comprehensive guide can be found in [workflow_guide.md](https://github.com/NakerTheFirst/Flashcard-generation/blob/main/workflow_guide.md). For debugging, see the [Known Issues](https://github.com/NakerTheFirst/Flashcard-generation/edit/main/README.md#known-issues) tab below.

## Quick Start
1. Create a new LLM chat
3. Learn your material first (read & understand completely)
2. Write a template prompt, add flashcard guidelines as `guidelines.txt` file, add source material and potential notes
4. Generate flashcards using LLM of choice
5. Import, verify, and enhance in Anki

## The Workflow
### 1. Human Learning (Prerequisite)
- Read & understand source material completely
- Identify what needs memorising (facts, formulas, procedures)
- Optionally, create rough notes with main ideas and questions

### 2. AI-Assisted Generation (5-10 mins)
Prompt selected LLM with:
```
I need Anki flashcards for the following material.
Please follow the guidelines.txt.

[Paste your source material]
[Optional: My notes: ...]
```

LLM generates:
- Atomic questions (one idea per card)
- Multiple angles for important concepts
- Source references [page/timestamp]
- Pipe-separated format for easy import

### 3. Verification & Enhancement
- Import pipe-separated text to Anki
- Quality check each card:
  - Answerable in <8 seconds?
  - Tests only ONE thing?
  - Clear in 6 months?
- Enhance with screenshots, personal context, mnemonics

### 4. Learning & Iteration 
- Initial review of all cards
- Identify problem cards (consistently wrong, too slow, ambiguous)
- Reformulate and break down as needed

## Time Savings
- Traditional manual creation: 1-2 hours per chapter
- This hybrid approach: 20-30 minutes per chapter
- Quality: High (combines human understanding + AI efficiency)

## Essential Principle
**Understand first, memorise second.** The AI handles card formatting and generation, but you must understand the material before creating flashcards.

## Known Issues
- **Markdown code blocks**: The output generated by LLMs is sometimes embedded in ```backticks``` of markdown code blocks, these need to be removed (happens often in Gemini models) before importing flashcard set
- **Large file hallucinations**: The bigger the file uploaded, the higher are the chances of model hallucinating some flashcards. PDFs of about 30 pages work perfectly fine, but 100 page ones might need to be broken down into smaller parts
- **Separator importing compatibility**: The default flashcard separator in guidelines.txt is set to pipe operator: "|". For Quizlet imports, you might need to set a custom separator to "|" or change it for semi-colon ";", in the guidelines.txt file
- **Customisation**: Generally, the model instructions are set in guidelines.txt. You can fix or work around many issues by changing them
- **Model performance**: The model that seems to perform well with this project is Claude
